            <summary>How welcoming is Morocco to LGBTQ travellers?</summary>
            <p>Morocco is more accepting than other nations in Africa when it comes to
      the affection between LGBTQ people. The city of Tangiers has been
      offering respite to LGBTQ visitors for over a century and Marrakech is
      moving in a similar direction. With that said, conservative attitudes still
      prevail, and homosexual acts remain illegal. It is expected that all visitors
      maintain an understanding of cultural sensitivity concerning this issue.
      Discretion is to be practised regardless of orientation at sites of antiquity, as
      well as during day-to-day touring.</p>
